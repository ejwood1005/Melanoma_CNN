## Melanoma_CNN

Problem Statement:

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Goal:

Reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis using CNN

Model 1

There is huge variance between the Training Accuracy & Validation Accuracy. 
Training Accuracy is at approx. 90% and validation accuracy at approx. 55% is indicating that there is an overfitting issue.
Applying Data Augmentation Technique to resolve the overfitting issue.

Model 2

The variance in Training Accuracy & Validation Accuracy has substantially reduced from Training Accuracy is at approx. 90% and validation accuracy at approx. 55% without data augmentation.
The current training accuracy approx 60% and Test Accuracy greater than 50%.
Looking at enhancing the accuracy of the model using Class Distribution and reducing the imbalances

Model 3

The model accuracy for Training is around 60% and validation accuracy is around greater than 55%.
The variance has been reduced from the initial model of Training Accuracy at approx. 90% and validation accuracy at approx. 55% without data augmentation.
After using data augmentation, it was around training accuracy approx. 60% and Test Accuracy around 50%.
After reducing the class imbalances and data augmentation the training accuracy is greater than 60% and Test Accuracy above 56%, this has helped in better accuracy and resolving overfitting.
With the limited total population sample of 2239 and training sample size of 1792, the results generated have proved that is a good model for prediction.
Multiple code runs had been done
